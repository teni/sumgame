This is a game about sums. You are presented with a grid of numbers, a number X at the bottom center and a timer. Your job is to choose numbers from the grid that sum up to X before the timer runs out. Good luck.

This is version 0.0.1.... it is soooo unfinished. If you have ideas and want to help you are welcome.


Thanks .





INSTALLATION GUIDE

You need to have Java installed on your PC.

I'd upload the executable later but for now you need to compile the code yourself.

javac *.java

to run it

java init


thanks again
